        <h2> Maidan Nezaleznosti </h2>
        <h3>The main square of the country,</h3>
        <p>The most popular and visited place in Kiev among tourists and residents
        of the city, and, of course, a direct participant in such iconic and famous events far beyond Ukraine, as Ukraine
        without Kuchma in 2000. The Orange Revolution in 2004 and Euromaidan in 2013. </p>
        <p>Until the 10th century, instead of Maidan, you would not have believed -
        a swamp, from which, let’s say, is not a very pleasant smell. At the beginning of the 18th century. Only in 1830, when
        the ancient Kiev shafts were finally demolished, a real square began to form, and in 1876 the City Council building was
        built here. </p>
        <p>Here you can find a lot of cafes and restaurants with different cuisine and on a different price. Every weekend a music
        is played here, an amateurs dancing and hundreds people are enjoying a strolling. In a warm weather here working a
        beautiful fountains, which light all night. </p>
        <p>Come here on weekend and feeling the atmosphere of Kyiv. </p>

        <h2> Khreshchatyk </h2>
        <h3>The widest street in Europe</h3>
        <p> The street appeared at the beginning of the XIX century. Until that time, Khreshchatyk was called the area along the
        Dnieper, where Vladimir the Great baptized his relatives. In the days of Kievan Rus, there was a forest-covered valley
        along which a stream flowed out of a lake in the area of ​​the current Independence Square, which merged with the
        Klovsky stream in the area of ​​Basseynaya Street. </p>
        <p>
        The stream was not allowed into a ditch like the Glubochitsa River, which flowed between Verzhny and Nizhny Val. Because
        of this, the townspeople had big problems during heavy rains. From the neighboring hills the creek was filled with water
        and the houses were flooding heavily. </p>
        <p>In 1888 a single stream was launched inside a large brick pipe and it was covered with earth. An innovative solution
        flew into the city a pretty penny - 100,000 rubles. </p>
        <p>Surprisingly, few people know that under the fashion boutiques, restaurants and expensive cars on Khreshchatyk this
        stream still flows and it has not disappeared. 
        - at the end of September 1941, almost the entire Khreshchatyk was destroyed by a series of powerful explosions.
        Explosives in the houses were laid by the NKVD detachments retreating from the city

<h2> Kontraktova Ploshcha </h2>
<h3>Must see in winter</h3>
<p>Kontraktova Ploshcha - in the 15th century, it was calling “the Market Square”. In 1811 was damaged with fire and rebuilt
again.</p>
<p>In 1976, a metro station was built here and today, taking advantage of it, Kiev
residents and guests of the Ukrainian
capital can reach the main square of Podol in minutes. </p>
<p class="last-text">In winter, there is a Christmas market with a Christmas tree, hot drinks, traditional souvenirs and goodies. Warm
yourself by trying a mulled wine on a freezing winter.</p>

         <h3>Pedestrian bridge, Dnieper embankment</h3>
      <p>For me, and for most locals, one of the best places to walk. The best time is a warm summer evening. Sit near the
      Dnieper River and watch the sunset. You can have a snack by choosing something in one of the street benches, or bring
      something with you. You can also cross the bridge and take a stroll around Truhan Island.
      </p>
      <h3>Trukhanov Island</h3>
      <p>The island is a green oasis in the city center. Spend day with a noisy
      company or family here. Most popular this area in the summer, but it also gteat place at other times of the year.</p>
      <p class="last-text">There are beaches, sports fields, gazebos, cafes, the Dnieper park zone. Find what you need. Some people always walking
      around the island, others enjoying the scenery or working out. Island is great place for biking or
      rollerblading

<h2>River Station Kyiv</h2>
<p>Kyiv river port is a main transport node and a port for river transport. It is situated in the historic region of the
capital of Ukraine – Podil, which used to be the trade-crafting centre of Kyiv long ago. The goods exchange took place
mainly on the main river artery of Ukraine – Dnipro.</p>
<p>
  When boats began to walk actively along the Dnieper River in the early 19th century, many marinas were spread along the
  river.
</p>
<p>
  The new river port harbor was built in 1897-1899 and was at that time the largest in the Russian Empire. It was one of
  the longest river harbors in Europe.
</p>
<h2> Get trip on the boat </h2>
<p>
Try 1 hour trip along the Dnipro
River in Kyiv and saw beautiful
Podil buildings, golden domes of ancient temples - the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra, Vydubitsky Monastery and other.</p>
<p class="last-text">Or if you have more time, let’s get 8-hour trip along the Dnipro through the Kyiv Sea (the Kyiv Reservoir) and landing
in Mezhyhirya (old house ex president of Ukraine), where visitors have
3 hours to walk around the residence.</p>

          Total height is 102 meters, weight is 500 tonnes. The tallest monumental sculpture in Europe. The monument represents an eclectic style. It synthesizes the traits of
          Soviet pre-war art with its cult of the Renaissance ideal of physically and aesthetically
          developed person that was the dominant model of
          socialist realism style. Now is allowed to raise excursionists on the 36 and 92 meters height sites.
        </p>
     
        <p>
          In the 1950s, a plan circulated of building on the spot of the current statue twin monuments of Vladimir Lenin and
          Joseph Stalin, nearly 200 m (660 ft) tall each. However, this did not go ahead. Instead, according to legend, in the
          1970s, a shipload of Communist Party officials and Soviet sculptor Yevgeny Vuchetich looked across at the hills by the
          Lavra and decided the panorama needed a war memorial.</p>
          <p>Final plans for the statue were made in 1978, with construction beginning in 1979. It was controversial, many criticised
          the costs involved and claimed the funds could have been better spent elsewhere.</p>
          <p>In modern-day Kyiv, the statue remains controversial, with some claiming it should be pulled down and its metal used for
          more functional purposes. Financial shortages mean that the flame, which uses up to 400 m3 (14,000 cu ft) of gas per
          hour, can only burn on the biggest national holidays, and rumours persist that the statue is built on unstable
          foundations, something strongly denied by the Kyiv local government.</p>
          <p>In April 2015, the parliament of Ukraine outlawed Soviet and Communist symbols, street names and monuments, in a
          decommunization attempt. But World War II monuments are excluded from these laws. Director of the Ukrainian Institute of
          National Remembrance Volodymyr Viatrovych stated in February 2018 that the state emblem of the Soviet Union on the
          shield of the monument should be removed according to the decommunization laws. To date however, it has still not been
          removed.

        <h2>The Holy Dormition Kiev-Caves Lavra</h2>
        <p>According to the ancient Church Tradition, in his travel with the Christian message in the Skythian land, saint Apostle
        Andrew the First-Called (Protocletos) blessed the hilly Dnieper riverside and turned to his disciples with such words:
        “Do you see these hills? God’s grace will shine over these hills, and a great city is to be founded, and many churches
        to be raised by God.” Thereupon, the Lavra monastery together with the first churches of Kievan Rus became the
        fulfillment of the prescient words of the Apostle.</p>
        <p>
          Since its foundation as the cave monastery in 1051, the Lavra has been a preeminent center of Eastern Orthodox
          Christianity in Eastern Europe. Together with the Saint Sophia Cathedral, it is inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage
          Site. The monastery complex is considered a separate national historic-cultural preserve (sanctuary), the national
          status to which was granted on 13 March 1996. The Lavra is not only located in another part of the city, but is part of
          a different national sanctuary than Saint Sophia Cathedral. While being a cultural attraction, the monastery is once
          again active, with over 100 monks in residence.[citation needed] It was named one of the Seven Wonders of Ukraine on 21
          August 2007, based on voting by experts and the internet community
        </p>
        <h2>Caves</h2>
        <p>The caves formed two separate groups - the Far and Near. In the caves are stored the millennial relics of saints.
        The length of labyrinth without joint from the south Varagian Caves is 293 meters. Under the ground there are active
        churches.</p>
        <p>
          The Kyiv Pechersk Lavra caverns are a system of narrow underground corridors (about 1-1½ metres wide and 2-2½ metres
          high), along with numerous living quarters and underground chapels. In 1051, the monk Anthony settled in an old cave in
          a hill near the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra. This cave received additions including corridors and a church, and is now the Far
          Caves. In 1057, Anthony moved to a cave near the Upper Lavra, now called the Near Caves.</p>
          <p>
          Foreign travellers in the 16th–17th centuries wrote that the catacombs of the Lavra stretched for hundreds of
          kilometres, reaching as far as Moscow and Novgorod, spreading awareness of the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra.
